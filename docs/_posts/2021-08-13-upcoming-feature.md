Since Discord still not enabling [age limitation for slash command](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/discussions/3581) as of today (14/08/2021), this feature will be on halt:
- `Ecchi` related genres on all anime/manga related commands. Once this age limitation is delivered by discord, I will able to implemented as at least I can make a control for 18+ related materials
- `Duckduckgo` command is disabled for now on global as I can 100% assure the search will be SFW friendly untill the age limitation is arriving.
