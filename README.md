# Template/Boilerplate
This is a simple template of command handler for discord.js version 13 for me to easily making new bot.

## Requirements

- `git` command line ([Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)|[Linux](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)|[MacOS](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)) installed
 - `node` [Version 16.6 or later required](https://nodejs.org)


## Intents

By default the template needs the `GUILDS` Intents. You can add on another intents based on your need!
Command(s) may not working without proper intent.

For more info about intents checkout the [official Discord.js guide page](https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/intents.html) and the [official Discord docs page](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#gateway-intents).
